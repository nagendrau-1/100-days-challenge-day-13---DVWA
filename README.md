# 100-days-challenge-day-13---DVWA

On Day 13, I practiced on DVWA, a deliberately vulnerable application. It helped me understand how basic vulnerabilities exist due to poor coding practices.

DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) is a deliberately insecure PHP/MySQL web app used to learn and practice web security vulnerabilities legally.

 What DVWA is used for
 
•	Practice ethical hacking in a safe lab

•	Understand how vulnerabilities work (not just tools)

•	Ideal for beginners → intermediate learners

 Vulnerabilities you can practice
 
•	SQL Injection (SQLi)

•	Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) – Reflected & Stored

•	Command Injection

•	File Inclusion (LFI/RFI)

•	Brute Force attacks

•	CSRF

•	File Upload vulnerabilities

•	Weak Session Management

 Security Levels
 
DVWA has 4 difficulty levels:

•	Low – no protection (easy to learn basics)

•	Medium – basic filters

•	High – stronger protections

•	Impossible – secure code (learn defense)

 Requirements
 
•	Apache / Nginx

•	PHP

•	MySQL / MariaDB

(or use Docker, XAMPP, Kali Linux – DVWA comes pre-installed in Kali)

 Why professionals use DVWA
 
•	Learn real-world attack logic

•	Safe environment (no legal risk)

•	Helps in bug bounty, pentesting, SOC analysis

•	Improves report writing and exploitation understanding
